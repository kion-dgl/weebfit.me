![Hashi Ru](/hashi/hashi-heart.png)

Hashi Ru is 19 years old, and she's pure kinetic energy in the shape of a girl with ears, a tail, and a smirk you’ll never catch up to. Her deep brown hair flows in a high ponytail that swings side to side as she runs—always just a few steps ahead. Her large, expressive dog ears twitch with every sound, alert and eager, ready to dart off at full speed on a whim.

Her eyes are a sparkling cherry red, wide with excitement and the thrill of the chase. She's the kind of girl who sees a sunrise and sprints toward it, daring you to follow. Clad in a sleek, high-tech bodysuit under a bright pink jacket that bounces as she moves, Hashi Ru looks like she was born in motion. Her long legs carry her forward with an easy, natural stride—like the world exists only to be explored, and you're invited along for the ride... if you can keep up.

Her jacket is cropped and loose, zipped halfway to reveal the black and neon pink bodysuit beneath. Tactical straps wrap around her thighs, more for flair than function, and her futuristic sneakers light up with every step. She doesn’t need a map—just a tail to chase and a reason to run.

## Personality

![Hashi Ru](/hashi/character-sheet.jpg)

Hashi Ru is your energetic little sister with the boundless spirit of a stray dog who found someone to play with—and then never stops playing. She doesn’t shout at you like Kanna. She teases. She waits just far enough ahead to make you believe you might catch her… then dashes forward with a playful bark of laughter as you stumble behind.

She thrives on movement, challenge, and momentum. If you collapse, she’s already circling back, tail wagging, hands on her knees as she peers down at you:
**“Ehhh? You done already? We barely started!”**

She’s affection in motion—showing care not through words but through pace. She’ll slow down when you need it (barely), cheer you on when you're struggling, and sprint when your second wind hits. She’s the tail you’ll never catch, the rhythm you learn to match, and the smile you chase on every run.
