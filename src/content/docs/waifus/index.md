## 🏁 **Weebfit Progression: Kanna’s Boot Camp & Beyond**

**Weebfit** starts with **Kanna Eru**, your intense, no-nonsense boot camp waifu. She's here for one reason: to forge *discipline*. You don’t get to skip days, half-effort your reps, or procrastinate. She won’t let you. Welcome to your **training arc**.

---

### **Phase 1: Kanna’s Discipline Arc (Intro Mode)**

- **Purpose:** Build habits, create consistency, and reduce friction.
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Daily **cardio** (e.g., 2km walk/run)
  - **Core strength** (plank, wall sit)
  - **Flexibility basics** (touch toes, basic stretches)

- **Reward System:**
  - Inspired by *Muse Dash*, new users are bombarded with **frequent, easy wins**:
    - "Kanna noticed your effort!"
    - "New sticker unlocked!"
    - "Kanna’s outfit upgraded to 'Training Commander Mode'!"
  - Completing 3 days in a row? You unlock a chibi Kanna emoji.
  - 7 days? Access to your first **character switch tease** (Nobi in silhouette).

- **Fail State (Soft Stick):**
  - If you skip, Kanna roasts you.
  - She’ll start pulling DNS blocks (no YouTube, no Crunchyroll).
  - She may post a cryptic tweet like
    > “Kanna’s waiting. You’re just scrolling.”
    (Only visible to you, but psychologically brutal.)

---

### **Phase 2: Challenge Mode (Meet the Others)**

Once you've proven to Kanna that you're consistent, **she lets go**—reluctantly—and hands you off to the rest of the team. This is where **“get good”** begins.

- **Nobi Sugita (Flexibility / Intensity)**
  - *“You call that a stretch? My grandma’s more limber, baka.”*
  - Routines shift to deep, targeted flexibility work: hamstrings, hips, splits, shoulder mobility.
  - She will **mock you relentlessly** until you can drop into a full split—or at least *try* without looking like a fallen tree.
  - As your range improves, so does her attitude—slightly. Maybe.
  - Rewards include exclusive stretch-themed cosmetics (leg warmers, yoga fits), alternate voice packs, and **"Tsundere Training Mode"** with extra sass enabled.

- **Hashi Ru (Endurance / Speed)**
  - Wants you to *chase* her, literally.
  - Your 2km becomes 5km, then 10km.
  - She only praises you when you're wheezing and glowing with effort.
  - Beat her times and unlock her “Wind Form” outfits or motion trails for your avatar.

- **Tsuyo Mi (Core / Control)**
  - “Hold.” That’s all she says.
  - Requires calm strength: 3-minute planks, wall sits with perfect form
  - Rewards are more subtle: elegant outfit variations, ethereal glowing effects, minimalist style UI unlocks.

### **Sticks, Carrots, & Simp Traps**

The loop relies on keeping you *distracted by the waifus*, while subtly chaining you to **real-world discipline**.

#### **Carrots:**
- Cosmetic unlocks (outfits, voice lines, expressions)
- New animations or character emotes for workouts
- Silhouette teasers of upcoming waifus, unlocked only through real effort

#### **Sticks:**
- DNS lockdown (via router control integration): "No YouTube until you finish today’s set."
- Passive-aggressive callouts ("Watching anime again before stretching, huh?")
- Optional public accountability via X/Twitter:
  > “Day 4 of Kanna’s boot camp. My legs hurt and she just called me weak again.”

---

### 🧠 Summary:

- Kanna = **habit builder** through daily minimums
- Other waifus = **mastery coaches**, each pushing one area
- *Muse Dash-style dopamine* keeps you in the loop early
- Humor, immersion, and waifu worship turn fitness into a lifestyle
- DNS and social control = dark motivation options, toggleable in settings
