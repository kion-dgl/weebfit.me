![Tsuyo Mi](/tsuyo/concept.png)

Tsuyo Mi is 23 years old, and she doesn’t need to raise her voice to command a room—her silence does the work. Pale lavender hair cascades like silk down her back, shifting from silver to violet in the light, echoing the quiet strength she embodies. A delicate hairpin shaped like a plum blossom rests above one ear, the only ornament on a woman who believes restraint is power. Every step she takes is purposeful, every glance a challenge.

She wears a modernized kimono top, cinched tightly at the waist with reinforced fabric and silver clasps—less tradition, more tactical elegance. Hints of amethyst swirl along her sleeves like smoke or muscle memory. Thigh-high black stockings rise from sleek heels, their embroidered patterns pulsing faintly with energy. Her overall silhouette is serene—but the second you’re in plank position under her gaze, you feel the tension ripple through your core.

This is not a woman you impress with words. She’ll stroke your cheek the moment your arms start to shake—not in comfort, but in quiet judgment. And if your form breaks before the timer hits zero? She won’t say a word. She’ll just reset the clock.

## Personality

![Tsuyo Mi](/tsuyo/character-sheet.jpg)

Tsuyo Mi is calm, collected, and unwavering—a pillar of strength and stillness. Where Kanna is heat and chaos, Mi is ice and control. She’s the type to hold eye contact for too long, to make you question your willpower without ever speaking. She rarely smiles, but when she does, it’s subtle—and usually when you’re suffering in perfect form.

She speaks softly, if at all. Her instructions are minimal, her expectations infinite. She values discipline, endurance, and precision over passion. Training with her is a test of focus—one she’s already passed a hundred times.

To earn her respect is to survive her silent regimen. To earn her affection? Well… you’d better be ready to hold that wall sit until your legs give out.

## Background

Tsuyo Mi is a grad student who never learned how to stop grinding. Raised by wealthy tiger parents who demanded excellence, she was told: no dating, no distractions, just results. Her childhood was a blur of tutors, drills, perfectly managed nutrition, and lonely birthdays with cake cut into macros. She was never the fastest or the flashiest, but she outlasted everyone—through sheer will.

Now she’s in grad school, still training, still aiming high. But lately, things feel different. Her parents, once strict and cold, have started dropping hints about grandchildren. Dating. Marriage. Stability. And Tsuyo doesn’t know how to handle it. No one ever taught her what came after achievement.

So she lingers at the gym. Not because she needs to—but because it’s the only place where effort still makes sense.
