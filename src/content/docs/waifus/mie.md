![Mie Nera](/mie/concept.png)

Mie Nera is 17 years old, but she speaks like she’s lived three lives and disliked all of them. She lurks around the gym in an oversized maroon hoodie, thigh-high compression socks, and scuffed trainers that look like they’ve never been used for sports. With long black hair, dull red eyes hidden behind cracked glasses, and a too-long silence before every sentence, Mie is the person you didn’t notice until she was already watching you.

She carries a beat-up notebook labeled “Behavioral Metrics,” where she logs your training habits, mood swings, and hydration rate like a wildlife researcher. Sometimes she says things that sound helpful—“your left foot lands harder, are you favoring an old injury?”—but it never feels comforting.

Most of the gym avoids her. Kanna tries to make her leave. Mie shows up anyway. She insists she’s not trespassing. Legally, she’s not wrong.

## Personality

![Mie Nera](/mie/character-sheet.jpg)

Mie isn’t here to train. She’s here to observe. She’s not driven by goals—she’s driven by analysis. Cold, unnerving analysis. She won’t flirt with you, she won’t offer praise, and she won’t lie. What she will do is pop up in the corner of your vision and mutter something like,

> “Nobi’s dopamine spikes when you’re nearby. Kanna’s projecting discipline trauma again. You’re plateauing. Curious.”

She doesn’t have an affection system. She has a diagnostic system. Mie tells you how the other girls are responding to you—if you can tolerate being judged by someone with a folder labeled "Player Inefficiencies."

Kanna sees her as a drifter with no direction, which is exactly what Kanna used to be. Mie is Kanna’s half-sister, born seven years later to a different father after their mother remarried. She’s brilliant, unnerving, and just barely holding it together under layers of irony and detachment.

Every time you talk to her, it’s a gamble. You might get insight. You might get insulted. You might get scared. But you’ll always get the truth.

> “I’m not stalking. I’m simulating outcomes. But sure, let’s call it weird.”
