![Kanna Eru](/kanna/concept.png)

Kanna is 24 years old, and everything about her exudes intensity, energy, and unapologetic dominance. Her dark blue hair, streaked with electric blue and hot pink, flows in sharp twin ponytails that bounce with every commanding step she takes. Perched atop her head are sleek cat ears, blending cuteness with intimidation—a warning that she plays both coach and enforcer.

Her eyes are a vivid violet, almost glowing beneath the neon lights of the futuristic gym she calls her domain. Screens flicker in the background, casting shifting pink and purple hues across her skin, but your focus never drifts far from her. She's sculpted, confident, and unmistakably powerful—the embodiment of “no excuses.”

Kanna’s outfit is as bold as her attitude. She wears a white sports top with a daring boob window, revealing her toned abs and the relentless discipline behind them. A black jacket hangs loosely around her waist, its sleeves marked with tech-like patterns and straps. Her short black gym shorts, trimmed with pink neon accents, ride high on her thighs, paired with black thigh-highs that add an edge of stylish flair. A high-tech utility belt cinches her waist, loaded with gear that hints she’s always ready to level you up—or knock you back down.

## Personality

![Kanna Eru](/kanna/character-sheet.jpeg)

Kanna is your overbearing older sister meets elite trainer—a waifu with a mission. She’s blunt, high-energy, and endlessly driven to push you beyond your limits. If you’re slacking, she’ll call you out. If you’re improving, she might give you a rare smirk of approval (and then double your reps). She’s not cruel—she’s committed, and expects the same from anyone under her watch.

She throws anime references your way with just enough sarcasm to make you wonder if she’s secretly a weeb—then shuts you down before you can ask. Her affection system runs on sweat, streaks, and completed challenges. She thrives in neon-lit chaos and structured discipline. You might fear her a little—but you’ll never skip leg day again.
