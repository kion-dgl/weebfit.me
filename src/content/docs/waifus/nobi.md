![Nobi Sugita](/nobi/concept.png)

Nobi Sugita is 22 years old, but your joints will swear she’s older—like an immortal yoga demon sent to test your limits. Her candy-pink twin tails flare like angry energy spikes, tipped in electric cyan that crackles with attitude. Her outfit’s a sharp clash of white, black, and neon magenta—half idol, half sci-fi field medic, and all dangerously bendy. She struts around in a cropped tech jacket, shorts just barely within dress code, and belts that don’t seem functional—unless they’re for pulling you into deeper stretches. (They are.)

Don’t be fooled by her short stature or the permanent blush on her cheeks. Nobi isn’t embarrassed. She’s furious. Furious that you’re not trying hard enough. Furious that your back arch is mid. Furious that she cares—even if she’ll never admit it.

Her presence radiates a heat you can feel when she steps near, like you’ve been pulled too close to a flame. You’ll hear the scuff of her boots behind you before you feel the yank. And when your body screams in protest, she’ll glare at you with those sharp aqua eyes and mutter,

“I said breathe through it, baka.”

## Personality

![Nobi Sugita](/nobi/character-sheet.jpg)

Tsundere with a mission. That’s Nobi in a nutshell. She insists she doesn’t like helping you stretch—she’s just making sure the team doesn’t fall behind. She definitely didn’t come to check your posture because she was worried. And she absolutely didn’t blush when you thanked her afterward.

She’s irritable, intense, and lightning-quick to call you an idiot… usually after saving your progress, patching your form, or catching you before you fall. Her guidance style is “pain first, praise never,” and yet somehow, when she storms off in a huff, you’re already looking forward to the next session.

She won’t hold your hand. She’ll twist your leg behind your head, roll her eyes, and bark that she told you to warm up first. And if you manage to earn a single “...not bad” from her?

You’ll treasure it forever.
