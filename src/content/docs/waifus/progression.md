## Game Flow Overview

You begin your journey training under **Kanna**, the boot camp instructor who acts as your mentor and gatekeeper. Kanna teaches you the fundamentals of form, motivation, and mental discipline. As you prove yourself through training milestones, she slowly unlocks access to the other girls, each with their own philosophy, history, and emotional complexity.

### Progression Structure

1. **Start: Kanna Eru**
   - The player's entry into the gym world.
   - Teaches basic routines and mindset.
   - Once the player completes her first training block, she begins referring you to other girls she "knows from the gym."

2. **Unlock: Nobi Sugita**
   - Requires: Completion of 2 weeks with Kanna and a demonstrated consistency stat.
   - Kanna introduces you directly to Nobi.
   - Nobi refuses to engage until formally introduced.

3. **Unlock: Tsuyo Mi**
   - Requires: Demonstrated discipline and clean form (evaluated by training scores).
   - Kanna mentions her as someone who trains seriously.
   - Tsuyo begins to appear at the front desk and eventually offers advanced training.

4. **Unlock: Hashi Ru**
   - Requires: Completing cardio benchmarks and asking about other trainers.
   - Kanna casually mentions her after a jog.
   - Hashi appears running around the gym perimeter or on treadmills before allowing interaction.

5. **Mie Nera**
   - Always present, never introduced.
   - Starts as a passive observer, becomes interactable after the player earns enough social trust across other characters.
   - She provides appraisals on your standing with the others, not affection.
   - **Mie functions as a diagnostic system**, analyzing your progress, providing health data insights, and making brutally honest observations about your performance, sleep patterns, diet, and stamina.
   - She has a makeshift lab setup—part creepy den, part analytics station—where you can check your stats and occasionally get cryptic hints about underlying systems or future unlocks.
   - Think of her as the E. Gadd of the game: eccentric, sharp, unsettling—but always right.

## AI Personality System

Each character is driven by an **AI prompt-packet** that includes:
- **Character backstory & voice**
- **Emotional constraints (what they will/won't say)**
- **Visible vs. hidden opinions of the player**
- **Behavioral shifts triggered by story benchmarks**

Characters are not open-ended chatbots. They live inside a structure. You can talk to them freely, but:
- They won’t engage in depth until **you earn it**.
- Each character’s AI “unlocks” deeper behaviors based on your **achievement flags**.

### Example:
- Nobi’s prompt keeps her cold and dismissive until the player clears Kanna’s trust gate.
- Once unlocked, Nobi still evaluates you silently for several encounters before acknowledging improvement.

This creates a hybrid of **freeform interaction and narrative gating**, where conversations feel organic, but character development remains tightly authored.

## Summary
- The player starts with Kanna.
- Each character is introduced through progression.
- AI manages personality and responses.
- Unlocks are based on specific achievements, not generic affection.
- You don’t chase romance—you chase trust, clarity, and connection.
- **Mie serves as a meta-character**, providing in-game data, commentary, and health tracking through her own strange, semi-scientific interface.
